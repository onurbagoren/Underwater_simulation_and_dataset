# üåä Underwater Simulation and Dataset Index
This repository was initiated following the AQ¬≤UASIM workshop at [ICRA 2025](https://sites.google.com/view/aq2uasim/), held on May 23, 2025, in Atlanta, GA. The workshop emphasized the critical role of realistic, open-source simulation environments in overcoming the high entry barriers of underwater robotics research. By providing cost-effective, risk-free platforms for testing and development, these tools aim to accelerate innovation in the field.

Our goal is to curate a comprehensive list of publicly available underwater **simulations** and **datasets** that support research in **perception**, **state estimation**, and **sensor modeling**.

If you know of a valuable resource not listed here, please open a pull request or issue to contribute.

## üìå How to Contribute

Please format new entries using the existing table. Indicate applicability to perception, state estimation, and/or sensors with ‚úÖ or ‚ùå. Use ‚ÄúN/A‚Äù for datasets without a simulation engine.
I will try to handle the pulls monthly.
